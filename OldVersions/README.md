There are several files listed mostly for history. They are not advised for use. These are versions 2 and 3 (I have lost version 1 if you were curious as to its absence. However is was more or less a direct copy of the amazing answer provided by this poster on stackexchange: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/211502/how-can-i-use-a-unit-vector-notation-found-in-physic-texts). Version 4 is more complete. It is a stable build and the currently advised version. It is only in 2d, it implements the common operations of adding, dotting, and scalar multiplying. Most importantly, it can transform vectors from one coordinate system to another (the only two implemented are 2d cartesian and polar). It also requires you to use the symbols x y r phi in your code. There are consequences to this described in the notebook. The main feature however, which is the nice physics syntax/notation is fully implemented.
